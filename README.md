# minimalist-todo
A minimalist TODO app...It's in the name, really

## Motivation
I wanted to do this to develop/test some 'native' web components techniques and see how far (near) I can push things to get a 'framework DX' without a framework

## "Techniques"
- using template strings to generate HTML
- binding events (including custom events) in HTML
- using 'Named access on the Window object'
- using light DOM in Web Components
- extending the DOM API

I understand that most of these techniques are frowned upon, but in today's world of front-end frameworks, they aren't really that bad if you think about it.
